"""Follow a chat and print each new message as one line.

Every line is an event: the identifier, who sent it, and the text with newlines folded
away, so a reader that consumes lines sees one message per line. The service pushes each
message as it lands, and a read catches up on what came while no stream was open. That
read asks from the last message seen rather than for a count of recent ones — asking for
the last N loses whatever arrived in between and repeats what did not.

Both sides are followed. A message the account itself sent from a phone is as much an
event as one that arrived, and a watcher that hides it shows half a conversation. What
tg.py sent is the exception: the agent wrote it and already knows it, so it is left out.

A hook starts the watcher fresh on every run, so the mark it resumes from can live in a
file, and a command can be run for each new message instead of reading the lines.
