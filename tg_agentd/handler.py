"""Turn one request into one answer, deciding by the permission files alone.

Every answer says what decided it. An allowed action names the granted word, and says
when that word was the wildcard, because one word standing for a whole table is a
different decision from a word naming the action. A refusal names the line that would
lift it, so the user can act on it without reading the vocabulary first.

Nothing here trusts the request. The identifier is validated before it becomes a path,
the action is looked up in the vocabulary before the account is touched, and a broken
permission file is an answer rather than a crash: the service serves other chats after it.
